Welcome to my blog, here is a few things about it that might be important.

## I am human.  

Don't expect unbiased reporting. 
I am human, I am opinionated. 

## I am a student.

I am still learning. 
Hopefully you can learn along with me. 

## Code

I generally use python to talk about general things in programming. 
Python is well known and hopefully easy to understand even for those that are not fluent. 

General preformatted text looks like this (config files etc):

    # Do a thing
    do_thing()

Python code and output looks like this:

```python
# Prints '2'
print(1+1)
```

Math looks like this:

$E=mc^2$
